 - HashTable using modular hashing; in case of collisions, a deque is used to store the values with the same hash.
 - SymbolTable implemented using the hashtable for storing the symbols of the language.
 - ProgramInternalForm is a list containing tuples storing the token and its location in the SymbolTable or the Tokens.in depending on the type of the token.

The input program is scanned into tokens which are furthermore categorized into reserved tokens, constants or identifiers.
The constants and identifiers are each added to their own SymbolTable.
Then the ProgramInternalForm is formed by storing the tokens and their position in the SymbolTable or Token.in.
