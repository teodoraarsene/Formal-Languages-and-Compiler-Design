Assignment:
    -> Symbol Table:
        - separate tables for identifiers, respectively constants (create 2 instances)
    -> Symbol Table (you need to implement the data structure and required operations):
        - hash table

    The hashing is done by computing the sum of ascii codes modulo the size of the hash table.
    The elements of the hash table are singly-linked-lists, in this way the problem of collisions is handled.

    For the insertion of a new element in the hash table, the hash of the element is computed and a new node is created and added at the emd of the linked list positioned on the index with the hashed value.
    For the search of an element in the hash table, the hash is computed and then the search continues in the linked list corresponding to the hash position.
